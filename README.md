# Gap formation driven by planets in invisicd discs

This repository implements the methods of Cimerman & Rafikov (2021),
Cimerman & Rafikov (2023) and Cordwell & Rafikov (2024) to generate
synthetic surface densities of gap formed by a planet in a 
protoplanetary discs. The 1D axisymmetric surface density of the 
protoplanetary disk can  be generated within seconds and provides
a good fit (especially in the outer disk) to the evolution of the disk.

We provide implementations of the vortensity reconstruction methods 
in both python and matlab, however the linear analytic solution is 
only provided in python.

Please see the associated notebooks for examples of function calls and 
output.

Running the python implementation requires matplotlib, 
numpy and scipy to be installed. The matlab implementation works 
with base matlab.

Please note that the python and Matlab implementationa have similar 
looking but different commands to call (and a slightly
different implementation of the r to $\tau$ transformation).

## Implementation Description
CR21 generated a semi-analytical formula for the size of the shock
generated by a sub thermal mass planet in a globally isothermal disk.
They then used this to describe the linear evolution in vortensity $\zeta$.
CR23 extended this to reconstruct the surface 
density of a disk from its vortensity.

## Changes from the published papers
This repository includes an adjustment of $2 \pi$ multiplied to
$\Delta \zeta$. This was an error in the original paper due to a
mistaken normalisation, the evidence for this shift is shown in 
the python notebook example and a correction from the original 
authors is forthcoming.

## Use in further work
These codes may be freely distributed and modified as long as 
credit to the author (Amelia J. Cordwell) remains. Any use 
in a scientific publication should cite both this repository, 
and the relevant papers.
